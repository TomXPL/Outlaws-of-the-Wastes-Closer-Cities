# TODO

## The main list:
- Add more new factions and City-States, along with more new unique units and buildings for the existing factions (making sure all existing factions get at least 2 new unique components), and adjust the unique abilities of some of the existing factions. As the sole "Brave New World" type expansion for DeCiv, a major goal is for this expansion to have more new factions than any other expansion mod that exists for DeCiv Redux, while shifting the focus away from the wastelands of post-apocalypse North America.
- Add at least ten new technologies to address issues with the tech tree.
- The bane of all ambitious modders who have no artistic talent: adding custom sprites for everything.

## Other things to consider
- Expanding the "hero unit" concept past the Hero of the Wastes found at random in survivor/barb camps. This may require waiting until (or rather, *if*) true unique units (there can only ever be one of that unit between all civs and city-states combined, and the first civ to obtain that unit prevents anyone else from ever being able to obtain it) are properly implemented.
- Some sort of analogue to the Archaeologist unit of BNW and a reasonable way to generate them. Their unique improvement should guarantee access to the Artifacts luxury resource.

## Things I would like to be possible in the future, but are unlikely to happen
- The ability to create resources on tiles or remove resources from tiles during a game without cheating by directly editing the save file.
- Barbarian AI knowing how to utilize uniques which enable their units to freely create more encampments, amplifying the threat they pose (but also increasing the potential rewards for dealing with the threat).
- Aquatic Cities, and reworking the Mariners faction to encourage them to settle on the ocean and snag all of those resource tiles that all too often spawn too far away for anyone to work. (Well, this technically has become possible to an extent with the addition of terraforming mechanics...)
- An instant Non-Standard Game Over triggered by too many nukes being launched between all factions and a way to adjust how many nukes are required to trigger it.
